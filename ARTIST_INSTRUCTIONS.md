# How to Get Your Subtitles Translated

## What you need

A shared Google Drive folder called **"Watercolor Translations"** (you should have received access to this).

Inside it you'll see two folders:

- **input** — this is where you put your subtitle files
- **output** — this is where your translated files will appear

## Step by step

### 1. Upload your subtitle file

Open the shared **"Watercolor Translations"** folder in Google Drive and go into the **input** folder.

Upload your `.srt` subtitle file here. You can:
- Drag and drop the file into the browser window, or
- Click the **"+ New"** button and choose **"File upload"**

### 2. Let us know

Send a quick message that you've uploaded a new file. We'll run the translation.

### 3. Pick up your translated file

Once the translation is done, go to the **output** folder in Google Drive. You'll find:

- **`yourfile_en.srt`** — the translated English subtitle file
- **`yourfile_review.log`** — a short note listing any lines worth double-checking (for example, where "draw" vs "paint" was ambiguous)

The `_en.srt` file is ready to use right away. The `_review.log` is optional reading — only check it if you want to verify specific lines.

## Tips

- Make sure your subtitle file ends in `.srt`
- One file at a time or multiple files — both work
- If a translation needs to be re-done, just let us know and we'll re-run it
