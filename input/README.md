# Drop SRT files here

Upload your Chinese `.srt` subtitle files into this folder to trigger automatic translation.

## How to upload (no coding needed)

1. Go to this folder on GitHub in your browser
2. Click **Add file** > **Upload files**
3. Drag and drop your `.srt` file(s)
4. Click **Commit changes**
5. The translation runs automatically — check the **output/** folder for results

## What you get

- `output/<filename>_en.srt` — the English translation
- `output/review.log` — notes on anything the AI wasn't 100% sure about, with Chinese and English options for your team to review
